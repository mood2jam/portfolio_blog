    "Predicting basketball games is a popular pastime for enthusiasts of the sport as well as an important job in sports analytics. NBA front offices want to know if a certain player will give them the unique edge they are looking for to make it to the next round in the playoffs. There are many factors to consider when predicting wins: players, teamwork, chemistry, and variations in individual performance all come into play. Many models look at teams as a whole and use this to predict on court success. In contrast, we have developed a method that is able to predict team wins by combining player stats and normalizing them based on engineered features. This post looks at data scraping, clearning, exploratory data anaylsis as well as different machine learning methods for game predicition using classifiers and regressors. In the end, we are able to achieve close to 70% accuracy on our test dataset.\n"

    "## Our Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Much work has been done previously to predict wins. There are matchup predictors on popular sports websites like espn.com and fivethirtyeight.com and research papers have been written addressing the subject. For instance [1] highlights how OLS regression can be used to predict wins by incorporating strength of teams and other important factors including home team advantage, whether or not a team played back-to-back games, etc. \n",
    "Another example of game prediction comes from [2] where the authors use neural networks to help in their predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we approached our model we wanted to do something a little bit different. Instead of focusing solely on team performance/stats in predicting wins, we wanted the ability to remove and replace players on a team and see how that affects team performance. This would greatly help game prediction because often teams go into a new season with a new combination of players or players get injured throughout the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically we had the following questions: How can we swap out players to predict team performance? How do we adjust team stats so if a new player is hogging the ball (and minutes) it will diminish the effect of the other players around him? Can we simulate games by drawing from an empirical distribution of player stats and then combining them into team stats?\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe this model will fit into current research by offering a unique perspective on game prediction. It will offer the ability to look at different combinations of players to find the optimal lineups. The model also gives the ability to see how playing time, shot attempts, and free throw attempts of players affects team performance. This could be especially useful for coaches, who have control of how long to play specific players (playing time) and how much they should encourage players to shoot the ball (shot attempts) and how much to drive the ball (which leads to free throw attempts). \n",
    "\n",
    "By converting player stats into team stats, we can effectively simulate games by drawing from an empirical distribution of past player performance and then combining our draws into team data. We can then use the team data to predict head to head matchups. This is the overall idea of our model.  "

    "## Overview of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a model with these characteristics, we had to figure out how to turn player stats into team stats and what type of data we wanted to look at. In professional basketball, there are two types of stats: traditional and advanced. Traditional stats can be easily measured during the game like shots attempted and three-point shooting percentage. Advanced stats can be thought of as hand-engineered features made from traditional stats. For example effective field goal percentage, an advanced stat, takes into account that three-point field goals are worth more than two-point field goals and is normalized by field goals attempted. Advanced stats are useful because they are normalized and usually percentages. When predicting team wins, we decided to use advanced stats because of these favorable qualities. However, we need traditional and advanced player stats to create the advanced team stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our dataset has two parts, both from basketball-reference.com: a popular, valid source for team and player basketball stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Merged Player and Team Stats (Advanced and Traditional):` We use this table to draw from an empirical distribution. Once specific stats are drawn, we can convert them to team stats. This first part of the dataset covers the past two seasons (including playoffs). Drawing player statistics from too far in the past will not give a good representation of the player's current ability (the player is likely to improve or decline over long periods of time). \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](images/data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Merged Team Stats and Opposing Team Stats (Advanced):` This table goes back seven seasons. Since this data is is not labeled by team or player, we can use as much of it as we want. This is the data we use to train our logistic regression model. \n",

For our best model, this was around .44. This value is below .5 because it is more likely for the home team to win than the away team. We plan to use this win/loss ratio for any future predictions. We also calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which may be a better representation of classifier performance in this scenario. \n",

    "While regressing on player stats did poorly overall, this could be because we trained the classifier on average stats instead of regressed stats. Our thinking was that our classifier, used to a less accurate dataset, would do better overall with regressed stats as input. However, regressed stats and average stats may be fundamentally different enough (regressed stats probably have higher variance) that this may have heavily affected classifier results.\n",

    "Once we had a good way to predict game outcomes, we wanted to see which players were most important to their team's success. We did this by replaying the 2019-2020 season (up until December 31, 2019) for each team while removing different players from the team. If the team win percentage increased, that means that the removed player contributed negatively to game results. On the other hand, if the win percentage decreased, it meant that the player contributed positively to their team's success. Note that our algorithm did not take into account strength of schedule, as this would impact the win percentage of some teams more than others. \n",

    "\n",
    "![title](images/7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed an interesting pattern with these results. Almost all of the players that had the most positive impact are tall players that play close to the basket. Almost all the players that had the most negative impact are smaller players that handle the ball often. This could be because tall players may have a bigger effect on the game due to the fact that they can more easily make and block shots. It could also be that our algorithm heavily rewards actions that big-men excel at: rebounding and field goal percentage. On the other hand, smaller players turn the ball over often and our algorithm may weigh this heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that our algorithm is not perfect and there may be other factors not accounted for. For instance, while the smaller players above may negatively influence their teams in certain scenarios (probably because of shot inefficiency at times) they are also needed to help the other players succeed. Donovan Mitchell, for instance, appears on the negative side of our graph but is known to bail is team out of difficult situations where no one else can score the ball. His ability to attack the hoop opens up his teammates' options. Our algorithm probably doesn't take this into account when it simulates the Utah Jazz season without Donovan Mitchell. "

    "# Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "NBA game winning prediction is not only a interesting project to work on, but these predictions also attract people in the lottery industry. Both sports fans and speculators are interested in predictions on probabilities of game winning. This is something that many people bet money on, and many times it can lead to ethical problems. It is possible that referees and players try to fix game outcomes at times to win money. This will not only alter game outcomes, but the stats that we are using to analyze the different players. This is something we need to be aware of as we do future analysis and predictions. "

    "In conclusion, there are many factors to consider besides overall team stats when trying to predict team performance. Our model combines individual player statistics to predict team performance and we achieve 69.60% accuracy on predictions for games in the 2019-2020 season. We are also able to analyze which players contribute the most and least to their team's success. We hope are findings are beneficial to sports fans, coaches, and even the players themselves as we all enjoy the game of basketball. "
