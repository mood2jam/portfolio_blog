My name is Jamison Moody and I am currently a Master's Student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science. I am passionate about changing the world for the better with artificial intelligence. I got my Bachelor Degree in Applied Math at BYU, so I am passionate about the math works behind Machine Learning. 

Current research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science.

In my spare time I love playing/watching basketball (as well as analyzing it) and creating board games.
